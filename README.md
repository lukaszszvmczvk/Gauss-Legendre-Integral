# Gauss Legendre Integral
 
The main function (P2Z07_LSZ_integral.m) calculates the value of the double integral over the domain D = {(x,y) in R^2: |x| + |y| <= 1} by transforming it to the square [-1,1] x [-1,1] and applying composite 3-point Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

The tests (test*.m) verify the correctness of the program's operation. The remaining tests (test_num_*.m) verify the numerical properties of this method.

There is also a project report (P2Z07_LSZ.pdf) written in Polish.
